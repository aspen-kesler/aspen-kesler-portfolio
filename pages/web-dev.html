                    <p>I interned for Copper Hills High Counseling Center from August 2020 to June 2021. During my internship, I was tasked with integrating a related website that was built on Weebly.com to the main website built on WordPress.com. As apart of the transfer, I built a custom-coded menu bar to replicate the feeling of an external site within this company's main website. I also managed updates and security for the site during my internship. The screenshot to the right was taken May 2021. Contact me to hear from my reference.</p>

                    <p>I worked with Kids Read Uganda to completely rebuild their website. This project took 5 months, from January to May of 2021. This rebuild included a theme change, page-layout reconstruction, and functionality re-development. It was a pleasure to work with such an influential company and this project gave me the opportunity to explore GoDaddy's Website Builder and Hosting Service in depth. The screenshot to the right was taken May 2021, and the website has since been taken over by another web developer. Click the image to see the old Kids Read Uganda website.</p>

                    <p>One of the first things I ever hard-coded was a copy of CodePen's homepage. It took a lot of trial and error to get my code to match the actual homepage, but I finally got my finished product as shown to the right. I encourage anyone getting started in web development to complete a project similar to this one for themselves. It doesn't have to be this exact website that you copy, but take any website you can find and try to recreate the code yourself. This exercise will teach you a lot about interpreting visual elements into code. Click the image to download a zipped folder of my work.</p>
