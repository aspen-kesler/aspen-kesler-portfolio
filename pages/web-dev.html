                    <p>I interned for Copper Hills High Counseling Center from August 2020 to June 2021. During my internship, I was tasked with transfering a portion of the website that was built on Weebly.com to the main website built on WordPress.com. As apart of the transfer, I built a custom-coded menu bar to replicate the feeling being an external site within this company's main website. I also managed updates and security for the site during my internship. The screenshot to the left was taken May 2021. Contact me to hear from my reference.</p>
