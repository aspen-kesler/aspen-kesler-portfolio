                    <p>My name is Aspen Kesler. I’m a freelance front-end web developer through my company: <strong>Kesler Digital Expressions</strong>. I started learning web development through an early-college program during my senior year of high school and I'm continuing to teach myself new languages and programs all the time. I’m fluent in multiple web languages and certified in many Adobe programs.</p>

                    <p>When I’m not building websites or editing videos, I’m actively pursuing a career in the field of Interior Architecture and Design. I’ve loved exploring these two career paths and finding the similarities between them. I’m always looking for ways to be creative, help others, and expand my skill set.</p>

                <p>From August 2020 to June 2021, I interned for Copper Hills High School's Counseling Center as their junior web developer. During my internship, I was tasked with integrating a related website that was built on Weebly.com to the main website built on WordPress.com. As apart of the transfer, I built a custom-coded menu bar to replicate the feeling of an external site within this company's main website. Link to website below.</p>

                <p>I worked with Kids Read Uganda to completely rebuild their website. This project took 5 months, from January to May of 2021. This rebuild included a theme change, page-layout reconstruction, and functionality re-development. It was a pleasure to work with such an influential company and this project gave me the opportunity to explore GoDaddy's Website Builder and Hosting Service in depth. This website has since been taken over by another developer.</p>

                <p>This video was also a project for my ART 1080 class and was made using a rented GoPro360 Camera. I've since purchased my own GoPro360 and am looking for more opportunities to use and practice these skills.</p>
